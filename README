IQ X is the backend of next-generation IRC bots.

More specifically, IQ X is a collection of modules that run in xynapse, an event
processing engine. Events, such as a public message on an IRC channel, are
packaged into a JSON object by an IQ X frontend script running on an IRC client.
The event is sent to an IQ X server, a xynapse instance, where it is processed
by one or more event handlers. The event handlers can return commands back to
the frontend. A command may be to send text back to an IRC channel, for example.

IQ X is currently in a very early stage.
